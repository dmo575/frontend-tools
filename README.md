# About

This is a place where I will be adding different  components and front end features that I build as I practice, like a responsive navbar, an image slide-show component... things like that.

## What am I using
- Vite as the build tool
- React
- Plain JS/CSS/HTML

## How to see all the components

To check out any component, you just have to go into Sandbox.jsx and add in there the component you want to see. Some components need parameters, so please make sure to checkout the component first.

I will leave the components commented out once I finish adding them all in case you want to quickly try them.
